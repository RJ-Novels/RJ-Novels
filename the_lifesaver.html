        <p>The Academy’s Number One Cutest Kouhai Becomes a Fiancée and Commuting Wife!? A Half-Cohabitation Pure Love Romcom!</p>
<p>Midou Tomoya, who has advanced to his second year of high school, ends up saving the incoming first-year student, Shirazu Yuuka—rumored throughout the school to be one of its foremost beautiful girls—from a traffic accident.</p>
<p>He believes that his involvement with her concludes right there on the spot——or so he thinks, only to be informed by his father, who is away on an extended business trip, that Yuuka has now become his fiancée.</p>
