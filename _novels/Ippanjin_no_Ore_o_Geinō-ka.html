      <p>Elite Girls Can’t Leave This Guy Alone!!</p>

<p>“I’m just in the academic track…?”</p>

<p>Yuto Aoi, the secret son of a nationally beloved actor, enrolls at Ichiyo High School, a prestigious academy with diverse programs. All he wants is a quiet, ordinary student life in the academic track, but the girls in the performing arts program won’t leave him alone!</p>

<p>His childhood friend Akari Hotta, an aspiring idol, is so close to him that people suspect they’re dating. Meanwhile, he ends up living next door to Minase Nagisa, a rising young actress his age, leading to a lively and attention-grabbing daily life! To top it off, Yuto inherited the striking looks of his father, once hailed as a “national treasure-level heartthrob,” making him a hidden hottie with untapped acting talent.</p>

<p>When Nagisa recruits him as her partner for the performing arts exam, Yuto finds himself surrounded by charming, talented girls in this dazzling performing arts academy rom-com!</p>
