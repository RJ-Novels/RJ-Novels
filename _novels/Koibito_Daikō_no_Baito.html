      <p>This sense of distance――</p>

<p>It’s sad and frustrating.</p>

<p>Ryoma Shiba, a University student who lacks money, searches for a part-time job with a high hourly wage. On the other hand, Himeno Kashiwagi is a girl who proclaims she has no interest in love but wants a boyfriend.</p>

<p>At the same time, they both hear about “Lover agent” from their friends and immediately register, unexpectedly scheduling a date with one another.</p>

<p>On the day of their first meeting, they were both nervous, but despite that, they held hands and drank tapioca, passing the time as a couple would.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Himeno’s friend discovers them, and the situation gets awkward. When Himeno had trouble explaining, Ryoma lies, saying they were “dating”.</p>

<p>Ryoma acts as a real boyfriend, making Himeno’s heart pound…</p>

<p>This is a real love story that begins with a rental relationship.</p>
