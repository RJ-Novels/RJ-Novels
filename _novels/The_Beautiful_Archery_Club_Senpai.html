      <p>The usually proper and dignified Senpai turns into a useless mess thanks to my healing!?</p>

<p>Amemoto Touya is a high school student who loves healing and peace.</p>

<p>One night, Touya encounters the captain of the archery club, Watanuki Rino. There was something pitiful about the sight of her buying a massive amount of energy drinks at a convenience store…</p>

<p>Learning that Rino was working too hard every day to live up to the expectations of those around her, Touya resolved to help her.</p>

<p>As a result of Touya, who is well-versed in “healing,” giving it his all—</p>

<p>“Nngh… Ehehe.”</p>

<p>“She’s sleeping with a happy face again…”</p>

<p>Rino ended up spending all her time in Touya’s room!?</p>

<p>A reward-style rom-com where a usually dignified, super-strong Senpai becomes completely loose and defenseless in front of me!</p>
