    <div class="description">
      <p>When the mysterious Black Knight removed his mask--he turned out to be so powerful it couldn't be hidden anymore.</p>

<p>The "Black Knight"--a legendary figure who appears out of nowhere to save those in peril, then vanishes without revealing his name. With countless achievements under his belt, including rescuing a princess, the knight's identity has remained an enigma…</p>

<p>"They're saying 'The unknown hero--the Black Knight--is actually the disgrace of a marquis family,' my lord."</p>

<p>Wait, they figured it out!?</p>

<p>I was deliberately pretending to be useless and living a lazy life!</p>

<p>Now that my identity's been exposed, I can't even hide my strength at the academy anymore--everything's turned into a huge mess. The maid who looks after me (a noble lady I once saved) is weirdly smug about it, and even the princess I rescued is now head over heels for me and won't leave me alone!</p>

<p>Ah, whatever! At this point, I might as well go all out and do things my way, damn it!</p>
