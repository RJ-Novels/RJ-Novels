      <p>The comment section is going wild, stunned by Onii-chan’s strength!</p>

<p>In a modern world where dungeons appear and labyrinth conquest streams are commonplace, Jin Suzuta, an adventurer (and NEET) who’d do anything for his adorable little sister, Maya, finds himself in the spotlight. When Maya, a labyrinth streamer, faces a crisis, Jin accidentally overwhelms an S-rank monster… and instantly becomes a global sensation!</p>

<p>Jin’s viral fame triggers a flood of collab requests from popular, beautiful streamers! While such situations would typically spark controversy, Jin’s fans give their wholehearted approval, propelling him to stardom. But Jin himself?</p>

<p>“Forget about me—just subscribe to Maya’s channel!”</p>

<p>Oblivious to his own strength and the harem forming around him, Jin continues to dominate streams with his carefree, unstoppable style, all for the sake of his sister’s smile!</p>
