    <div class="description">
      <p>Sakuraba Aoto, a high school student who cherishes a peaceful and free hobby-filled life, is suddenly confessed to by the perfect beauty from the next class, Yunagi-san. Despite Aoto’s aversion to romance and his rejection of her offer to date, Yunagi-san stubbornly refuses to be dumped.</p>

<p>“Look, I said no…”</p>

<p>“Please, just give it a chance!”</p>

<p>After a heated argument, Aoto reluctantly agrees to date her under certain conditions. However, his assumption that she’d quickly lose interest proves wrong as Yunagi-san’s overflowing “I love yous” gradually win him over. Yet, Aoto has a deep-seated reason for being unable to embrace love fully—?</p>

<p>A heart-pounding, bittersweet rom-com battle begins between a reluctant boyfriend with baggage and a devoted girlfriend who refuses to give up!</p>
