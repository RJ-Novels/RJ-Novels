    <div class="description">
      <p>Minori Souta is an ordinary high school student. Today, he lives his daily life as usual.</p>

<p>Even though he’s like that. Every time he went to school, he felt happy.</p>

<p>Because there was a beautiful girl on the train that he boarded.</p>

<p>She had pure white hair and blue eyes. Her Western-like face was somehow fragile and pretty. She has an outstanding style and is so beautiful that she could be considered an idol or an actress.</p>

<p>[Ice Princess]. That’s what she called at the high school next door.<br>
Souta followed her with his eyes every time he got on the train. She rejected all the students that tried to talk to her, and now there are no other high school students on this train except for him and her.</p>
