    <div class="description">
      <p>In the autumn of his second year of high school, Tsujidou Masachika had just been appointed as the student council president when he found himself helping a student who was suspected of smoking in school.</p>

      <p>Her name was Ooba Monaka, a junior gal rumored to be a beautiful girl.</p>

      <p>He helped her on a whim, with no intention of getting involved. At least, that’s what he thought until…</p>

      <p>“I’ll do anything to thank you, Senpai~”</p>

      <p>For some reason, she became extremely attached to him!</p>
