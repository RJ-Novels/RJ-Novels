      <p>Unrivaled talent and charm! Living under one roof with four extraordinary sisters!?</p>

<p>Kiminaga Oriomi, a struggling student, gets caught working a part-time job in violation of school rules. To avoid expulsion, he’s assigned to serve as a housekeeper at the residence of the school’s chairman. But there’s a catch—the Kichijoji household is home to four breathtakingly talented and beautiful sisters who captivate everyone around them!</p>

<p>Kikuri, the eldest, is a renowned artist and VTuber. Ranka, the second sister, is a wildly popular streamer. Meru, the third, is a pro gamer. And Chinana, the youngest, is a genius voice actress. But despite their talents, their home life is a chaotic whirlwind—takeout meals, scattered laundry, and somehow ending up in Orimi’s bed!?</p>
