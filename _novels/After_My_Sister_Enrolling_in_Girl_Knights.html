      <p>Taking Care of My Knightly Sister, and Somehow I Got Noticed by the Queen</p>

<p>My sister enrolled in an all-girls knight academy. She excelled at the academy, which is renowned as the best in the kingdom–</p>

<p>“I told them you’re way stronger than me, brother!”</p>

<p>Uh, I’m just an ordinary guy… (Actually, that’s a lie. My brother is insanely strong. He just doesn’t realize it.)</p>

<p>Because of that, female knights from the academy came to see me, so I had a mock battle with one of them (the strongest knight in the academy instantly realized the vast difference in our abilities).</p>

<p>I also took care of them after exercise (my brother’s massages were a huge hit with the knights, and even the nobles started talking about it!)</p>

<p>Just by being myself, I caught the eye of the princess–wait, why?</p>

<p>An Unintentional Harem of Female Knights by a Self-Proclaimed Commoner Rising to the Top!</p>
