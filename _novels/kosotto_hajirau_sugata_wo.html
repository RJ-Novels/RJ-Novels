      <p>“Hey, don’t you want to see the inside of my uniform? You can do anything, you know?”</p>
<p>After school, in an empty classroom with no one around. The girl who took the photo of herself in her revealing uniform and indecent appearance was Shinomiya Rinoa, the elegant and adorable “School Princess”.</p>
<p>Even though I understood that it was a bad thing, I couldn’t resist photographing her alluring appearance, which was different from her usual appearance-Click.</p>
<p>“Anno-kun, did you get a good photo?”</p>
