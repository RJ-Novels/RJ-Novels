      <p>Avoiding Destruction, I Somehow Became the World’s Strongest</p>

<p>I reincarnated as Weiss Fansent, the depraved villainous noble in my favorite academy game. Wait, if things continue like this, I’ll be exposed by the protagonist for my misdeeds, lose everything, and ultimately meet my end as a minion of the Demon King in the destruction ending!?</p>

<p>If that’s the case, I have no choice but to gain overwhelming power and avoid the path to destruction!!</p>

<p>With little time left until the entrance exams, I began learning swordsmanship and magic from the S-rank adventurer Miruku Abitas, enduring grueling days of effort.</p>

<p>A few years later, when I displayed my mastery of all elemental magic and creation magic during the entrance exams, everyone around me was left stunned.</p>
