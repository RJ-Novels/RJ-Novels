      <p>I never thought it would turn out like this. On my usual way home, walking alone like usual, I came across a gyaru who was about to fall on her bike. I somehow managed to save her and fixed her bike. But even though I intended to leave, saying, ‘Well then, I’ll be going,’ for some reason she took a liking to me. And after we got involved in this and that, finally, for the first time in a long time, I, an inkya, had a friend… Aah, right. It seems she doesn’t intend to stop at being friends.</p>
