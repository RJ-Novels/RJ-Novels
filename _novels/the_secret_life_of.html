      <p>“If you keep my secret account hidden, I’ll do something good for you, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ninety percent impure, ten percent pure love” — that was the beginning of a secret relationship just between the two of us.</p>
<p>“If you promise not to tell, I’ll make sure you have a good time.”</p>
<p>Aisaka Akito happened to discover that Mamiya Yuu, the model honor student who sat next to him, was actually a “secret account girl.” To keep his mouth shut, she made him tag along as her photographer for those hidden account photos.</p>
