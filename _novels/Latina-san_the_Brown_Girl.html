    <div class="description">
     <p>“High schooler Makoto Itou may have a slightly higher s*x drive than his peers, but he’s really just an ordinary boy in high school. However, his mundane life takes a drastic turn when he encounters the bright and cheerful Latina, a brown-skinned transfer student from a foreign country! After rescuing her from a group of overbearing men, Makoto… is being pressured into marriage and making babies with Latina?!</p>

<p>Between the passion of her appeal and the appeal of her body, Makoto finds himself – and his lower self – in danger of letting it all out! After all, Makoto isn’t without troubles himself; he became unconfident after experiencing a major setback when he first started high school… But the earnest, straightforward, and kind-hearted Latina, with her unconventional values, is sure to restore his vigor!</p>

<p>Thus begins the energetic romantic comedy of the high school girl with sun-kissed skin!”</p>
