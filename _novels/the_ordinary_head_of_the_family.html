      <p>“That Incompetent Subdues Even Gods and Annihilates His Enemies!”</p>

<p>Due to the unprecedented calamity known as the “Miasma Deluge,” a boy named Hachiman loses his magical power and memories. As the last survivor of the most powerful onmyoji clan, the Kuzuryu Family, he is nothing more than an incapable, ornamental figurehead. Living peacefully with his adoptive mother and sister, who cherished him despite his shortcomings, Hachiman’s world is shattered when a massive outbreak of monsters claims their lives.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with grief, he stands at the brink of despair—until a fateful encounter changes everything.</p>
