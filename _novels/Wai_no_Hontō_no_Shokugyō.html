    <div class="description">
      <p>If it’s discovered that he’s not the strongest [Holy Knight] , he’ll be executed immediately!?</p>

<p>—His weapon is none other than his own libido.</p>

<p>[Holly Knight] .<br>
It is a special profession bestowed by the gods upon those who turn 15, standing at the very pinnacle of all vocations.</p>

<p>A certain boy named Ars also received his calling—</p>

<p>“What the hell is a [s*xual Knight] !?!”</p>

<p>What he was granted was the [s*xual Knight] , a class that consumes s*xual desire to activate its skills!?</p>

<p>Yet, upon hearing Ars’s heartfelt scream, everyone around him mistook it for [Holy Knight] and went into a frenzy celebrating the birth of a new Holy Knight.</p>

<p>Before he knew it, Ars was swept away to the royal capital and even granted an audience with the king as the [Holy Knight] …</p>

<p>Falsifying one’s divinely granted profession is treason against the gods—an instant death sentence.</p>

<p>However, in front of the king, his skill —powered by the sheer quantity of his libido—demonstrated absurd, overwhelming strength…!?</p>

<p>Officially recognized as a [Holy Knight] , Ars is then assigned to protect the Saintess—</p>

<p>but… ?</p>
