      <p>Yatsuhashi Hazuki is just a regular high school student at Kuroba High and also the student council president.</p>

<p>But lately, because the number of students has been going down, Kuroba High is being merged with an all-girls school—Shiramine Girls’ High.</p>

<p>Since this is the first year of the merger, both schools will share the student council, led by the presidents from each school.</p>

<p>The president from Shiramine is a beautiful, cool, and almost perfect girl named Yukimiya Hyouka—often called the “Ice Goddess.”</p>
